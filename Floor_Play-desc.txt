<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Montessori Play Zone</strong></h1>

<h2>🏡 Imaginative Spaces for Big Little Adventures</h2>
<p>
In this special corner of the main room, the <strong>Montessori Play Zone</strong> invites rejuves to rediscover the world they once knew—now through smaller, playful lenses. Towering <strong>house play structures</strong> line one side, perfect for transforming into cozy cottages, bustling offices, or whatever their imagination desires. Each house is outfitted with miniature furniture, offering a pint-sized experience of the grown-up world they left behind, but one they will return to soon. Every room inside these homes is a stage for creativity, from hosting tea parties to throwing extravagant make-believe dinner parties.</p>

<h2>🍽 A Culinary Playground</h2>
<p>
Across from the houses, a vibrant <strong>kitchen setup</strong> gleams with colorful plates, bowls, and all the tools needed to whip up imaginary feasts. The pots clink, the spatulas swirl, and the air is filled with the scent of... pretend soup! Rejuves can cook up their favorite meals and serve them with flourish, honing fine motor skills and practicing the art of culinary creativity. The setup isn’t just fun; it mirrors the world they once knew, giving them the chance to experiment with grown-up activities in a playful, safe way.</p>

<h2>🍋 Shop 'Til You Drop: A Mini Marketplace</h2>
<p>
Not far from the kitchen is the bustling <strong>grocery store setup</strong>, a delightful mix of reality and make-believe. Shelves are stocked with real and pretend produce—lemons, apples, even shelf-stable candy that looks almost too good to be true. There’s a charming little stand outside, where rejuves can "sell" their goods to friends or practice counting out change for candy purchases. Prices are clearly marked, and real money is accepted here, making each transaction a playful lesson in financial responsibility. From filling shopping carts to managing the cash register, this little marketplace is where rejuves can act out the daily tasks of adulthood in an exciting, hands-on way.</p>

<h2>🏗 Building the Future—One Block at a Time</h2>
<p>
For the budding architects and engineers, the <strong>construction zone</strong> is the heart of this play area. Here, rejuves can operate a large manual crane with sturdy hand-cranks, moving giant <strong>foam blocks</strong> equipped with metal plates. These blocks, light but impressive, can be stacked to create towering structures—sometimes reaching all the way to the ceiling! Whether they’re building skyscrapers, castles, or bridges, each creation brings a sense of accomplishment and the joy of hands-on learning. The crane adds a dash of realism, allowing them to experience the thrill of working together to bring their designs to life.</p>

<h2>🎨 Where Learning Meets Play</h2>
<p>
The <strong>Montessori Play Zone</strong> is more than just a fun space; it’s a world where learning and play go hand in hand. Every toy, every structure is designed to simulate the adult experiences the rejuves once had—and will have again—encouraging independence, responsibility, and creativity. It’s a place where imagination thrives and the future seems just a little closer, all while keeping the focus on the joys of play. Whether they're whipping up a pretend dinner, building the next great tower, or practicing their shopping skills, rejuves here are always learning—one joyful moment at a time.</p>
