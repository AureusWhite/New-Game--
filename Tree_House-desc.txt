<p>At the end of the path, you see a <strong>sturdy wooden ladder</strong> leading up to the treehouse. The ladder has <strong>rope railings</strong> on either side, and it’s set at a friendly angle so climbing it feels safe and easy. As you step inside the treehouse, you notice something surprising—it feels much <em>bigger</em> on the inside! The floor is covered in soft, <strong>outdoor carpet</strong> that looks and feels like grass, making it comfy to sit or play on.</p>

<p>Along the walls, there are some <strong>chairs</strong> and a small table in the corner. On the table, a few <strong>games and puzzle pieces</strong> are scattered about, like someone was playing and decided to take a break. You also notice something a bit unusual for a treehouse—there’s a <strong>working sink</strong> and even a <strong>mini fridge</strong>! It’s almost like a tiny house up here.</p>

<p>The windows have no glass, but there are <strong>wooden shutters</strong> you can close to keep out the chilly wind on colder days. Outside, there’s a <strong>deck</strong> that wraps around the treehouse, with high railings to keep you safe as you look out over the yard. From up here, you can see the adorable little chimney of the Tea House down below. There’s even a <strong>ladder</strong> on the side that leads to a secret <strong>hatch</strong>—perfect for sneaking between the treehouse and tea house when you want a change of scenery!</p>
