<p>A <strong>large, well-kept lawn</strong> stretches far into the distance, like a giant green carpet rolled out just for you to play on. In one corner of the yard, you see a <strong>treehouse</strong> sitting proudly in the branches of a big tree, casting a cool shadow over a cute little <strong>playhouse</strong> right next to it. Each one has a cheerful sign—one says "Treehouse" and the other says "Tea House," just in case you forget!</p>

<p>Paths made from <strong>recycled tires</strong> wind their way around the yard, like a twisty snake, leading to all the fun things to play on. The main path goes straight to the treehouse and tea house, but if you follow the little side paths, you'll find a whole playground to explore! There's a <strong>jungle gym</strong> for climbing, a <strong>bounce house</strong> for jumping, and even a big tube for crawling through like a sneaky little hamster.</p>

<p>All around the yard is a <strong>bright yellow fence</strong>, with <em>yellow sunflowers</em> and silly trees painted on it. The artwork looks like it was done by kids—maybe it was a project from last year! As you glance up at the sky, you notice a faint buzzing sound. Yep, those are drones flying overhead, keeping an eye on everything to make sure you're safe. So, don't worry—the yard might be outside, but it's still part of the watchful care of the grown-ups.</p>
