<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Blue Hall of Knowledge</strong></h1>

<h2>💙 A Corridor of Calm</h2>
<p>
The <strong>Blue Hall</strong> serves as the calm and steady heart of the school, where learning and administration meet. The walls are awash in gentle shades of blue—cool and peaceful, like the sky before dawn—creating a space that feels safe and quiet. This soothing atmosphere sets the perfect backdrop for a day filled with discovery and growth.</p>

<h2>📚 Classrooms of Curiosity</h2>
<p>
On one side of the hall, rows of neatly organized <strong>classrooms</strong> beckon with promise. Inside, desks and chairs are arranged in thoughtful patterns, as if encouraging ideas to flow freely between them. The walls are splashed with <strong>bright, colorful posters</strong>, featuring smiling letters, happy numbers, and clever animals all eager to teach. Large windows let in the morning light, making the classrooms feel warm and inviting, while <strong>interactive whiteboards</strong> stand ready for teachers to share their wisdom and spark new ideas.</p>

<h2>🏫 The Headmaster’s Domain</h2>
<p>
Opposite the classrooms, tucked behind a sturdy wooden door, lies the <strong>Headmaster's Office</strong>. It's a grand yet cozy space, filled with big leather chairs perfect for sinking into during important talks. A polished desk stands in the center, piled high with important papers and mysterious books that seem to hold the secrets of the school itself. The shelves are lined with books on every subject imaginable, making the office feel like a tiny library. This is where decisions are made, and where rejuves can find a listening ear when needed.</p>

<h2>⏳ The Detention Den</h2>
<p>
Further down the hall, you’ll find the <strong>Detention Hall</strong>, a quiet space meant for reflection. The room is designed with small desks separated by tall partitions, creating little nooks for rejuves to focus and think about their actions. Though the decor is more subdued than the rest of the hall, there’s a sense of purpose here—this is a space where responsibility is learned, and growth happens in silence. Even the walls seem to whisper, “This is your time to be still and think.”</p>

<h2>🔍 Clear Pathways</h2>
<p>
Throughout the <strong>Blue Hall</strong>, helpful signs guide every visitor, whether they're heading to class, meeting with the headmaster, or reflecting in detention. The hallways are wide and easy to navigate, designed with thoughtful touches to ensure that no one ever feels lost. Every inch of the Blue Hall reflects a commitment to learning, order, and care, making it the true hub of both academic adventures and administrative wisdom.</p>
