    <p><strong>Motto:</strong> <em>Rights first, Science and Policy after.</em></p>
    <p>
        A Rebel advocates for the immediate restoration of adult rights to rejuvenated individuals, emphasizing the primacy of personal freedom over prolonged research and regulation. They argue that a rejuve who can successfully navigate the same obstacles and challenges as an adult should be granted the corresponding rights and privileges. According to this view, the essence of maturity lies in the adult memories and experiences retained through rejuvenation, which should be honored and recognized as sufficient for reclaiming their adult status. Rebels contend that physical and mental capability, rather than arbitrary age-based restrictions, should determine a rejuve's readiness to reintegrate into society as a fully functioning adult.

        A Loyalist believes that extensive research must precede the widespread restoration of adult rights and privileges to rejuves. They argue that rights should be developmentally appropriate, matching the rejuve's chronological age rather than their mental recollections. Loyalists caution that the juxtaposition of mature thoughts within an immature brain presents unknown challenges and potential risks. For them, the focus should be on understanding the long-term implications of rejuvenation, ensuring that rejuves are not prematurely exposed to responsibilities and freedoms that their still-developing bodies and minds may not fully handle. Loyalists advocate for a cautious, science-driven approach that prioritizes the safety and well-being of rejuves and society as a whole.
