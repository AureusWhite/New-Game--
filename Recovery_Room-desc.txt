<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Awakening Room</strong></h1>

<h2>✨ A New Beginning</h2>
<p>
This is the room where you <strong>woke up</strong> after your procedure. The first thing you notice are the <strong>empty hangers</strong> on the wall, gently rattling as the wind from the open, sunlit window blows through. Those hangers used to have your uniform hanging on them, but now they’re all bare, swaying softly in the breeze, almost like they’re waiting for your return.</p>

<h2>🛏️ A Reminder of Rest</h2>
<p>
Your bed is still <strong>unmade</strong>, with the blankets kicked off to one side and a pillow half-hanging off the edge onto the floor. It looks like you were in quite a rush to get up! The crumpled sheets and the disarray tell the story of your hasty departure. You don’t really remember much about recovering from the procedure… but maybe that’s for the best?</p>

<h2>🌙 An Untidy Transition</h2>
<p>
As you step out of this room in a groggy half-wake state, you can’t shake the feeling that it will remain untidy until the next arrival of a rejuve undergoing the procedure. The remnants of your awakening linger in the air, a quiet reminder of the journey that brought you here.</p>
