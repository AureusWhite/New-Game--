<p>This is the room where you <strong>woke up</strong> after your procedure. The first thing you notice are the <strong>empty hangers</strong> on the wall, gently rattling as the wind from the open, sunlit window blows through. Those hangers used to have your uniform hanging on them, but now they’re all bare, swaying softly.</p>

<p>Your bed is still <strong>unmade</strong>, with the blankets kicked off to one side and a pillow half-hanging off the edge onto the floor. It looks like you were in quite a rush to get up! You don’t really remember much about recovering from the procedure… but maybe that’s for the best?</p>
