</p><h2>Why We Have Special Schools</h2>
<p>
    After people become rejuves, their grown-up skills fade away, and they need help to relearn important things, just like little kids do. That's why special schools were made—places where rejuves can practice their skills, step by step. With every new thing they learn, they get closer to "graduating" and going back to the outside world as as rejuves with their friends anf family.
</p>
<p>
    But it's not just about getting back to normal. This school is very special because it's not like other schools. It's part of a research lab where rejuves themselves help keep it going. You see, rejuves have a unique gift—they still have their old memories, but they also experience the world with the same wonder and joy as young children. Because fewer real children are being born, people look to rejuves for the kinds of fun, creative things children used to make.
</p>

<h2>Rejuvenation Schools: A New Start</h2>
<p>
    These schools started out in research labs, but now they are a big part of society. People loved the artwork, crafts, and stories that rejuves create. Some people would do anything to experience that childlike magic again. In a world where fewer babies are being born, rejuves help fill a special role. Their drawings, finger paintings, and little handmade crafts are wanted by families who miss having children in their lives. Some people even wait on long lists, hoping to be picked by a lottery to have a child, but in the meantime, they cherish the things rejuves make.
</p>
<p>
    The rejuves are proud to share their talents, and in doing so, they help fund their own education. The more they create, the more they help keep the school running, and the closer they get to returning to the adult world. But it’s not always easy—rejuves must pass through different stages, mastering skills one at a time. When they do, they earn a “graduation” and the chance to go back to life outside these walls, this time as a rejuve, with all their memories and most skills returned.
</p>

<h2>How Does It Feel to Be a Rejuve?</h2>
<p>
    You might think it would be strange for a rejuve to do things like wear diapers or need help eating. But it’s not that simple—there’s more to it. Being a rejuve is about learning new things, even if you remember some of your old life. There’s a kind of joy in getting to experience the world like a child again, especially when you know you’ll grow up again, adult life can wait.
</p>

<h2>Waking Up as a Rejuve</h2>
<p>
    A soft, gentle voice calls to you, encouraging you to open your eyes. When you do, the first thing you see is a small android, about three feet tall, covered in soft, fluffy fur. It looks just like a friendly teddy bear, comforting and kind.
</p>
<p>
    "Hey there, sweetie! You might feel a little confused, but don’t worry," the android says with a friendly smile. It wraps its soft arms around you in a warm hug. "You’re safe, and Fuzzy is here to help you. When you’re ready, I’ll help you get dressed. And don’t worry, my eyes aren’t watching!"
</p>
<p>
    Fuzzy pretends not to see, bumping into a table on purpose, making you laugh. After giving you some space, Fuzzy comes back to help you stand up. With a little bit of help, you get dressed, though those buttons are tricky at first!
</p>
<p>
    "Don’t worry, everyone has a little trouble with buttons at first," Fuzzy says with a soft chuckle, putting you at ease.
</p>
<p>
    Fuzzy’s screen shows a big, happy face, and then a shiny gold star pops out from his finger. He places the star on your hand, making you smile. Dressed and proud, Fuzzy starts reading you a fun story while you wait for the doctors to arrive.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe you'll remember things from your old life soon, but for now, you’re just a curious child in a new, exciting world. And maybe, just maybe, you're okay with that. After all, there’s still so much to learn, and graduation isn’t too far off. With every little craft, painting, and lesson, you’re getting closer to that moment when you’ll return to the outside world, full of the wonder only a rejuve can know.
