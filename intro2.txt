    <h2>Rejuvenation Schools and Existing Structures</h2>
    <p>
        Schools designed to accommodate rejuves emerged, initially within the laboratories of developmental psychology. The tests and procedures 
        were heavily influenced by existing developmental psychology frameworks. Policies, largely pre-existing, generally proved effective: 
        smaller desks, shorter facilities, and so on. With natural birth rates declining due to overpopulation, the educational industry found 
        itself without a traditional target audience. Repurposing the existing structures for rejuves seemed logical.
    </p>

    <h2>Complex Realities</h2>
    <p>
        You might think that rejuves, with their retained adult memories, would find it humiliating to be spoon-fed or have their diapers changed. 
        But the reality is far more complex and nuanced.
    </p>

    <h2>Awakening as a Rejuve</h2>
    <p>
        A soothing, harmonic but artificial voice gently beckons you to awaken. As you blink your newly minted eyes open, you see an android 
        about three feet tall, covered in soft fur and resembling a cuddly teddy bear.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Honey, you might be confused and not remember where you are," the surprisingly soft android says, wrapping its surprisingly strong 
        arms around you and cooing in a melodic, sing-song tone. "You're safe. Fuzzy is here if you need me. Just tell me when you're ready 
        to get dressed. Don't worry, my eyes are turned off."
    </p>
    <p>
        The android acts silly, pretending he can't see. He bumps into a table, making you giggle, and then wheels off to give you some space. 
        Eventually, you get up, and with a little help from Fuzzy, manage to get dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Don't worry, everyone has trouble with the buttons at first," Fuzzy reassures you with a gentle smile.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fuzzy's LCD screen displays a happy face, and then he prints out a shiny gold star from his finger, placing it on your hand with a flick. 
        Dressed and adorned with your gold star, Fuzzy begins to read you a story as you wait for the doctors to arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe your memory will return, but for now, you're a child again, filled with the wonder of a brave new world. And maybe, just maybe, 
        you don't want to spoil it by remembering too quickly.
