    <h1>The Revolutionary Impact of Rejuvenation</h1>

    <p>
        The introduction of rejuvenation was nothing short of revolutionary, marking a seismic shift in the landscape of medical science. Despite its shortcomings, no other medical breakthrough has come close to offering what rejuvenation promises: functional immortality.
    </p>

    <h2>Functional Immortality: A New Era</h2>

    <p><strong>Don't mistake this—people still die; it's just a far more challenging endeavor now. The days of slow, inevitable decline have been consigned to history.</strong> Rejuvenation therapy renews each healthy cell, reverting it to its stem cell state, effectively transforming an old, damaged, or diseased body into one that is virtually new.</p>

    <h3>Drawbacks of Rejuvenation</h3>

    <p>However, the treatment's first major drawback is that these rejuvenated cells are as young as the body they form. The body of a rejuve is immature, having skipped the hormonal and epigenetic milestones that naturally occur over time.</p>

    <h3>The Brain of a Rejuve</h3>

    <p>While the rejuve's brain is preserved as much as possible, it is adapted to fit within a smaller skull and body, with some unavoidable compromises in the frontal lobes. Although explicit memories remain intact, the rejuve loses procedural and implicit memories, leaving them as helpless as an infant initially. Though the pace of relearning is accelerated, it still takes years for a rejuve to reach their Chronological Equivalence (CE).</p>

    <h2>The Need for Formal Structure</h2>

    <p>This developmental delay necessitated the creation of a formal structure to support rejuves, which was promptly established with research funding from human trials—driven, unsurprisingly, by the wealthy elite's desire to cheat death.</p>

    <h3>Rejuvenation Schools and Existing Structures</h3>

    <p>Schools designed to accommodate rejuves emerged, initially within the laboratories of developmental psychology. The tests and procedures were heavily influenced by existing developmental psychology frameworks.</p>

    <h3>Repurposing for Rejuves</h3>

    <p>These policies, largely pre-existing, generally proved effective: smaller desks, shorter facilities, and so on. With natural birth rates declining due to overpopulation, the educational industry found itself without a traditional target audience. Repurposing the existing structures for rejuves seemed logical.</p>

    <h2>Complex Realities</h2>

    <p>You might think that rejuves, with their retained adult memories, would find it humiliating to be spoon-fed or have their diapers changed. But the reality is far more complex and nuanced.</p>

    <p>A soothing, harmonic but artificial voice gently beckons you to awaken. As you blink your newly minted eyes open, you see an android about three feet tall, covered in soft fur and resembling a cuddly teddy bear.</p>

    <p>
        "Honey, you might be confused and not remember where you are," the surprisingly soft android says, wrapping its surprisingly strong arms around you and cooing in a melodic, sing-song tone. "You're safe. Fuzzy is here if you need me. Just tell me when you're ready to get dressed. Don't worry, my eyes are turned off."
    </p>

    <p>
        The android acts silly, pretending he can't see. He bumps into a table, making you giggle, and then wheels off to give you some space. Eventually, you get up, and with a little help from Fuzzy, manage to get dressed.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Don't worry, everyone has trouble with the buttons at first," Fuzzy reassures you with a gentle smile.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fuzzy's LCD screen displays a happy face, and then he prints out a shiny gold star from his finger, placing it on your hand with a flick. Dressed and adorned with your gold star, Fuzzy begins to read you a story as you wait for the doctors to arrive.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe your memory will return, but for now, you're a child again, filled with the wonder of a brave new world. And maybe, just maybe, you don't want to spoil it by remembering too quickly.
