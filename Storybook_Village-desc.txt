<p>You step into a <strong>giant castle</strong>, but this isn’t just any castle—it's made to look like it's built out of <strong>books</strong>, with chairs and decorations inspired by your favorite stories! There are <em>Alice's mushrooms</em>, a <em>web from Charlotte's Web</em>, and even the <em>carousel horses</em> from The Very Hungry Caterpillar. All these magical pieces circle around a big, sturdy <strong>tree stump</strong> in the middle of the room. The tree stump has a <strong>comfy-looking seat</strong> on top, and guess what? It swivels! That way, the reader can turn and show the book to everyone, especially if there are too many rejuves to sit right in front.</p>

<p>Around the edges of the room, there's a special kind of <strong>barrier</strong> made of <strong>shelves and tiny step stools</strong>, so even the smallest rejuve can reach the highest books. There’s no need to ask for help—you can just grab what you want, climb up, and explore all the stories waiting for you!</p>

<p>Along the back wall, there’s a <strong>big board</strong> with a schedule showing the times for <strong>story time</strong> and the name of the teacher who will be reading each story. The whole room feels like a whimsical, colorful place straight out of a fairytale, full of surprises and fun just waiting to be discovered!</p>
