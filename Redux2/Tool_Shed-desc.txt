<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Tool Shed of Peril</strong></h1>

<h2>🌪️ A Whiff of Danger</h2>
<p>
As soon as you step inside the shed, the strong smell of <strong>sawdust</strong> and <strong>oil</strong> fills the air, wrapping around you like an unwelcome hug. You’re not quite sure how you ended up here, but one thing’s clear—this isn’t a place you’re meant to be! All around you, <strong>sharp tools</strong> jut out from the shelves, which are crammed with <strong>scary-looking chemicals</strong> for taking care of the lawn and pool.

<h2>🔪 Cramped Quarters</h2>
<p>
The shed feels <strong>really small</strong> inside, almost claustrophobic, made even tighter by the big, noisy <strong>lawnmower</strong> sitting right in the middle of the floor. It’s a tight squeeze, and you can hardly move without bumping into the shelves full of pointy tools! Honestly, it might be a good idea to leave before something dangerous happens—after all, curiosity can lead to unexpected adventures!
