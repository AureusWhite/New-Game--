<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Cubby Room</strong></h1>

<h2>📦 A Circle of Cubbies and Surprises</h2>
<p>
Welcome to the <strong>Cubby Room</strong>, a cozy circular haven where rejuves can safely stow away their personal treasures. Around the room, neat <strong>letterbox-style cubbies</strong> are arranged in a perfect ring, each with its own tiny wooden shutter. These shutters give the cubbies a charming, old-timey feel, as if each one hides a secret just for you! Above the cubbies, a friendly sign reminds everyone: "<em>Please do not open any cubby other than your own</em>," ensuring a sense of respect and privacy among all.</p>

<h2>🧥 Hooks, Boxes, and Belongings</h2>
<p>
Right above every cubby, a <strong>coat hook</strong> waits patiently for its next jacket, sweater, or cape (depending on the day’s adventures, of course). Beneath each hook, there’s a small, perfectly sized <strong>shoe box</strong>, neatly aligned and always ready to hold those indoor shoes or muddy rain boots that won’t be needed inside. The shoe boxes are a sight to behold, all in a row, almost always organized and inviting as if saying, "Come here, your shoes belong with me!"</p>

<h2>🏡 A Space for Everyone</h2>
<p>
The room’s unique circular design means that no matter where you stand, your cubby is always just a step or two away. The gentle curve of the walls creates a sense of harmony and order, making it easy for rejuves to find their belongings without any fuss. Each cubby feels like a little home within the room, a space that’s all yours—whether it’s storing your favorite jacket or a secret treasure. With everything in its proper place, the cubby room fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility, gently reminding rejuves that even the smallest spaces can hold a lot of care.</p>
