<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Playhouse Stage</strong></h1>

<h2>🎭 A Stage for Silly and Spectacular Performances</h2>
<p>
Tucked away in the liveliest corner of the main room, the <strong>Playhouse Stage</strong> stands ready for its next grand performance. With its simple charm, this little stage invites rejuves to embrace their inner actors, comedians, or puppeteers. At the side of the stage, a whimsical <strong>puppet crate</strong> waits eagerly, bursting with puppets of all shapes and sizes, ready to spring into action for the next big show. This is where imagination comes alive, whether it's a daring adventure or a heartwarming tale about the lost sock under the bed.</p>

<h2>🧵 Dramatic Lifts and Playful Twists</h2>
<p>
For those craving a little more drama, the stage boasts a modest <strong>wench system</strong>—perfect for those big, heroic moments. With a gentle tug, a rejuve can be lifted just a few inches off the stage floor, adding the perfect touch of theatrical flair to any scene. It may not be a grand ascent into the rafters, but for a moment, it feels like flying! Whether it’s the grand finale of a daring rescue or a slow, dramatic rise for comedic effect, the wench is always there to add just the right amount of magic.</p>

<h2>🍇 Fruit Flinging Fun for the Audience</h2>
<p>
But the real fun isn’t just on stage—it's in the <strong>audience area</strong>, too! Rows of comfy seating stretch out before the stage, but the real star of the audience experience is the colorful <strong>plastic fruit</strong> scattered about. Bananas, apples, grapes—you name it. When the performances get a little too corny (and trust us, they often do), the audience is encouraged to toss their fruity projectiles toward the stage in good-natured fun. It’s all part of the playful spirit here, where the sillier the show, the more flying fruit you’ll see!</p>

<h2>🕰 Green Time: The Show Must Go On</h2>
<p>
Every day, during <strong>green time</strong>—that magical part of the day when the sun is high and energy is brighter—the stage springs to life. Rejuves take to the boards, putting on their best (and often goofiest) performances for the crowd. There’s drama, there’s laughter, and sometimes there’s even a flying fruit salad! Whether it’s an epic puppet saga or a rejuve’s comedic debut, the stage is always buzzing with excitement during green time. It’s the perfect time for everyone to gather, laugh, and applaud the creativity that unfolds before their eyes.</p>
