<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Admin Hallway</strong></h1>

<h2>ðŸ”‘ A Locked-In Feeling</h2>
<p>
You find yourself in a <strong>stale, utilitarian hallway</strong> that looks like it could be part of any office buildingâ€”completely boring! The <strong>plain beige walls</strong> and <strong>thin carpet</strong> over the hardwood floor donâ€™t help make it any more exciting. Itâ€™s quiet, save for the creaks that echo with each step you take, as if the floor itself is determined to let everyone know youâ€™re here.
</p>

<h2>ðŸšª The Doors of No Return</h2>
<p>
All the <strong>doors</strong> in the hallway are locked, except for the one you just came through. That door, painted a bright <strong>blue</strong>, sticks out like a sore thumb against the drab fake wood finish of the others. Itâ€™s a clear sign that the blue door is your only way back to the <strong>Blue Hall</strong>â€”the places where you're supposed to be, so you wonâ€™t be <em>trespassing</em> anymore! Best to head back before you attract any unwanted attention.

<h2>ðŸ“œ A Familiar Feeling</h2>
<p>
Everything about this space feels just a little too much like <em>sitting outside the principalâ€™s office</em>â€”a bit too quiet, a bit too foreboding, and definitely not a place where you want to linger for long.
