<p>You find yourself in a <strong>stale, utilitarian hallway</strong> that looks like it could be part of any office building—completely boring! The <strong>plain beige walls</strong> and <strong>thin carpet</strong> over the hardwood floor don’t help make it any more exciting. As you walk, the floor creaks and makes way too much noise, almost like it’s trying to tell everyone you’re here!</p>

<p>All the <strong>doors</strong> in the hallway are locked, except for the one you just came through. That door is painted a bright <strong>blue</strong>, which makes it stand out from the other doors with their fake wood finish. It’s a clear sign that the blue door is the way back to the <strong>Blue Hall</strong>—and more importantly, the places where you’re supposed to be, so you won’t be <em>trespassing</em> anymore!</p>
