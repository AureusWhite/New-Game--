    <h1>A Text Adventure Game by JackalFac:E Games</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction and Prologue</h2>
    <p>
        In the not-so-distant future, humanity achieved a medical breakthrough: the ability to revert cells into stem cells, 
        effectively rejuvenating the body. This miracle of science, however, came at a steep price. Early on, poorer nations 
        and marginalized peoples rebelled against the notion of the wealthy buying their way to immortality, while the 
        disadvantaged were left to suffer and die. Initially, the rejuvenation process was expensive and rare, but with global 
        funding pouring in, a multinational effort was undertaken to complete the treatment within the lifetime of its very creators.
    </p>
    <p>
        Researchers were among the first to test rejuvenation, ensuring that fresh young minds could continue to perfect the technology. 
        Eventually, under the auspices of the <strong>United Nations of Earth (UNE)</strong>, the rejuvenation process became universally 
        accessible and free for all. However, with functional immortality came unforeseen challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept of prison as a punishment, which once subtracted precious years from one's finite lifespan, became obsolete. 
        Incarceration no longer served as an effective deterrent in this new world. So, an unusual solution was devised: instead of 
        imprisonment, criminals and 'undesirables' were regressed into children, shrinking in both size and stature, making them 
        easier to manage. They became known as <strong>rejuves</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this method led to yet another crisis: overpopulation. The UNE’s response was to introduce a maturity-inhibiting mechanism 
        in the rejuvenation process, halting physical growth until individuals could prove their readiness for adult responsibilities. 
        As a result, the world saw very few naturally born children. Society found its lost youth in us—the rejuvenated.
    </p>
    <p>
        But this system wasn’t without problems. The question of whether rejuves should be allowed to return to their adult lives 
        stirred heated debates. While their adult memories remained, the rejuves’ physical immaturity often caused behavioral complications. 
        Many mistakenly believed their retained adult memories gave them wisdom, but their emotional maturity often betrayed their youthful appearance.
    </p>

    <h2>The Revolutionary Impact of Rejuvenation</h2>
    <p>
        The introduction of rejuvenation marked a seismic shift in medical science, offering something no other advancement ever had: 
        <strong>functional immortality</strong>. While people still died, it became a much rarer occurrence. The days of slow, inevitable 
        aging were left behind, as rejuvenation therapy reverted each cell to its stem cell state, transforming old, diseased bodies 
        into virtually new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there was a significant drawback to this seemingly miraculous treatment. The rejuvenated cells were as young as the bodies 
        they created, skipping the natural hormonal and epigenetic milestones that occur with age. The mind of a rejuve, while preserved to 
        the best of the process’s abilities, had to adapt to a smaller body and compromised brain structure—particularly in the frontal lobes. 
        Though explicit memories remained, much of the procedural knowledge (like motor skills and instinctual reactions) was lost. Rejuves 
        initially found themselves as helpless as infants.
    </p>

    <h2>The Need for Formal Structure</h2>
    <p>
        To address these developmental gaps, a formal structure was put in place to support rejuves, funded by wealthy elites eager to cheat death. 
        Schools were established to help them regain skills, repurposing old developmental psychology frameworks to fit their unique needs.
