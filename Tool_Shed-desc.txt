<p>As soon as you step inside the shed, the strong smell of <strong>sawdust</strong> and <strong>oil</strong> fills the air. You're not really sure how you ended up here, but one thing’s clear—this isn’t a place you’re supposed to be. All around you, <strong>sharp tools</strong> stick out from the shelves, which are also packed with <strong>scary-looking chemicals</strong> for taking care of the lawn and pool.</p>

<p>The shed feels <strong>really small</strong> inside, almost cramped, and it’s made even tighter by the big, noisy <strong>lawnmower</strong> sitting right in the middle of the floor. There’s barely any room to walk without bumping into the shelves full of pointy tools! It’s a bit of a tight squeeze, and honestly, it might be a good idea to leave before something dangerous happens.</p>
