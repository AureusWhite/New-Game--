<h1>Mary is a Rejuve</h1>

<p>
    One morning, Mary woke up at a place called Busy Beavers. Everything felt new and a little strange. By her bed stood a friendly robot named Fuzzy. Mary didn’t know who Fuzzy was, so she got scared and started hitting him with her little fists.
</p>

<p><strong>“Pow, pow, pow!”</strong></p>

<p>
    But Fuzzy didn’t move. He just smiled kindly and said, “Hello, Mary! I’m Fuzzy, your helper and friend.”
</p>

<p>
    Mary stopped hitting and looked at Fuzzy. She didn’t feel as scared anymore. She tried to get out of bed, but her legs felt wobbly, and she fell down. Did Mary cry? Yes, a little. But did she give up? No way! She tried again and soon was standing all by herself.
</p>

<p>
    Feeling a bit stronger, Mary decided to run. She made it almost to the door, but Fuzzy, quick and gentle, stepped in front of her.
</p>

<p>
    “Oops! Not yet, Miss Mary,” Fuzzy said with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
    Mary giggled and tried to sneak past him—she crawled over, ducked under, and wiggled around—but Fuzzy always stopped her. It was like he could see everything, even behind him. And guess what? He could! Fuzzy had eyes in the back of his head, just like grown-ups say they do!
</p>

<h2>The Puzzle Room</h2>

<p>
    Soon, the doctors came in. Mary liked them because they made Fuzzy move out of the way. They checked her to make sure she was feeling okay. Afterward, they told her she could explore a room nearby.
</p>

<p>
    The room had puzzles, blocks, and a big table with shapes that fit into holes. It looked interesting at first, but after trying a few shapes, Mary started to think it was a little boring. The doctors watched to see what Mary would do next.
</p>

<p>
    Mary decided to try a puzzle, but it was harder than it looked. She worked and worked, but after a while, she got frustrated. The room was quiet, and Mary realized she was all alone. She didn’t like being alone, so she stopped playing with the puzzle and looked around for something else to do.
</p>

<p>
    That’s when Mary found a little toy car. She started pushing it across the floor, but—uh-oh!—one of the wheels popped off! Now the car was broken, and Mary didn’t know how to fix it.
</p>

<h2>The Fun Room</h2>

<p>
    Just then, the doctors came back and smiled. “You did a great job, Mary,” they said, and gave her a yummy snack, just like they promised. After her snack, they took her to a new room, one that looked much more fun! It had art supplies, colorful blocks, and even a big, squishy pillow fort!
</p>

<p>
    Mary crawled into the pillow fort and found other kids there. They were her new friends, and they played together all afternoon. Mary was having so much fun that she forgot all about being scared.
</p>

<h2>Time to Eat and Sleep</h2>

<p>
    Later, Mary felt her tummy rumble again, so she went to the lunchroom and had a good meal. After eating, she went back to the pillow fort and built tall block towers, drew colorful pictures, and laughed with her new friends.
</p>

<p>
    By the end of the day, Mary was tired. She had played so much that her eyes felt heavy. She said goodnight to her friends and snuggled into bed, feeling safe and happy.
</p>

<p>
    Mary learned that it’s okay to be scared sometimes. It’s even okay to let out your feelings, like when she hit Fuzzy. But it’s also important to keep trying, have a good snack, and get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow is a new day, full of new adventures!
